# Digital Signage

This is a digital signage prototype web app.

## Running

1. Clone this repo.
2. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your development machine.
3. Run `./docker_run.sh` to start up all the Docker images.
4. Open http://localhost:8081/admin/index.html to try it out.

## Architecture

We'll start with a very basic [Flight 
Information Display System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_information_display_system) (FIDS)
feature: Check-in Counter Activation.

The initial architecture is super simple; four separate layers/technologies:

1. Front-end/UI:
	1. Admin: React/JS
	2. Signage displays: Static HTML/CSS/JS
2. Back-end:
	1. Database: Postgres
	2. API: Flask/Python

```

                         |                  |
                         |(PostgreSQL)      |
                         +------------------+
```

## Future?

We'll take an iterative development
approach, i.e. by building a very simple prototype
and then gradually and slowly expand the
functionality until we have all the most common Check-in Counter FIDS features that
an airport might need.

Once that is done,
we'll add support for other display types, such as
the traditional arrivals/departures 
directory displays seen in any airport.
