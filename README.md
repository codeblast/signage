# Digital Signage

This is a digital signage prototype web app.

We'll start with a very basic [Flight 
Information Display System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_information_display_system) (FIDS)
feature: Check-in Counter Activation.

We'll take an iterative development
approach, i.e. by building a very simple prototype
and then gradually and slowly expand the
functionality until we have all the most common Check-in Counter FIDS features that
an airport might need.

Once that is done,
we'll add support for other display types, such as
the traditional arrivals/departures 
directory displays seen in any airport.
